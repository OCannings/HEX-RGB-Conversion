If you don't want these methods added to the window object simply modify the immediate function to pass in the JavaScript object of your choosing.

##### Methods:

- **toRGB** *(`String` color)*

	- summary: 
		- Converts a 6 digit Hexadecimal string value to an RGB integer array. Important! input must be a 6 digit Hexadecimal string "bad" will not convert correctly but "bbaadd" will. To keep the function as light as possible there is no idiot-proofing, if you pass in bad data I'm not fixing it for you :-)
	
	- color: `String`
		- 6 digit Hexadecimal string value
	
	- returns: `Array`
		- An array containing the RGB integers in the following format [red, green, blue]
